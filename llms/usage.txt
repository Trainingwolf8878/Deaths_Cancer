Me: Error in stan_glm.fit(x = X, y = Y, weights = weights, offset = offset,  : 
  Outcome variable must be specified if 'prior_PD' is not TRUE.

ChatGpt:It seems like the stan_glm() function requires the outcome variable to be explicitly specified in the formula when prior information is not provided. Let's adjust the formula to include the outcome variable, assuming it's called Deaths.

Here's the modified code:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(rstanarm)
library(readr)

# Read the simulated data
simulated_data <- read_csv("simulated_cancer_deaths_data.csv")

# Fit the model using rstanarm
sim_cancer_deaths_model <- stan_glm(
  formula = Deaths ~ Hospital_1 + Hospital_2 + Hospital_3 + Hospital_4 + Hospital_5 + Year,  # Adjust the formula accordingly
  data = simulated_data,   # Use your simulated data
  family = poisson(link = "log"),  # Use Poisson distribution for count data
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5),  # Prior for coefficients
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5),  # Prior for intercept
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1),  # Prior for auxiliary parameters
  seed = 853,  # Set seed for reproducibility
  prior_PD = TRUE  # Specify that prior information is provided
)

# Beep to indicate completion
beep()

# Save the model object
saveRDS(
  sim_cancer_deaths_model,
  file = "simulated_cancer_deaths_model.rds"
)
In this adjusted version:

I've included Deaths as the outcome variable in the formula.
The prior_PD = TRUE argument is used to specify that prior information is provided, which allows the function to run without specifying the outcome variable in the formula.
